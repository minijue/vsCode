Oracle today announced new innovations to Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse, the industryâ€™s first and only autonomous database powered by machine learning and optimized for analytics workloads. The innovations break through the proprietary and closed nature of traditional data warehouses and data lakes. In contrast, Oracle is providing native multicloud capabilities and open standard-based data sharing across databases, simplifying data integration and analysis with a unique low-code based tool, and transforming the economics of data lakes by providing ultra-fast enterprise storage at the same low cost as object storage. Customers can now rethink their data warehouse and data lake architectures without having to choose between performance and cost.
