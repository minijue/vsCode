            Out of the approximately 10,400 known bird species, about 1,300(13%)
            are classified as threatened with extinction, 9% as near threatened
            and of the remaining 78% populations are declining. There is a
            general consensus among scientists who study these trends that if
            human impact on the environment continues as it has one-third of all
            bird species and an even greater proportion of bird populaions will
            be gone by the end of bird populations will be gone by the end of
            this century. Since 1500, 150 species of birds have become extinct.
